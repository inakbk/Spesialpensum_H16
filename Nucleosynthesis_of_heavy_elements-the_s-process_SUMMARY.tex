\section*{Chapter 1.7.4: $\gamma$-ray Transistions in a Stellar Plasma}
Excited states are thermally populated. Since the timescale for excitation and de-excitation considerably shorter than the stellar hydrodynamic timescales these excited levels participate in nuclear reactions and $\beta$-decay. 

The number density $N_{\mu}$ of nuclei in excited state $\mu$ divided by the total number density of nuclei $N$ is given by a Boltzmann distrubution:

\begin{equation}
P_\mu = \frac{N_\mu}{N} = \frac{g_\mu e^{-E_\mu/kT}}{\sum_\mu g_\mu e^{-E_\mu/kT}} = \frac{g_\mu e^{-E_\mu/kT}}{G}
\end{equation}
(Assume nondegenerate plasma in thermodynamic equilibrium.)
what is P? the prob that occupies the excited state $\mu$? G is partition function

Thermally excited levels more important (higher prob.) with increasing temperature and lower excitation energy. 

\section*{Chapter 1.7.5: Isomeric States and the Case of \Al{26}}
Half lives ($\gamma$) 
\begin{itemize}
\item Non-isomers: $< 10^{-9}$ s
\item Isomeric/metastable states: isomers: sec, min, days
\end{itemize}

Caused by:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Large difference in spins between the states (large multipolarity, M4, E5)
\item Relatively small energy difference between levels (small $\gamma$-ray energy)
\end{enumerate}
both tend to reduce the decay probability.

\textbf{Ex:} \\
\Al{26} have a isomeric state that would recquire M5 rediation to de-excite to the ground state. More likely the isomeric state can decay by $\beta$-emission to \Mg{26}. Ground state of \Al{26} is also $\beta$-unstable and decays to an excites state of \Mg{26}.

The excited state of \Mg{26} de-excites so quicly that if it is polulated via nuclear reactions in the interiors of stars, the emitted photons would immediately be absorbed by the surrounding matter - would never escape the stellar production site and $\gamma$ never reach earth.

But if \Al{26} is synthesized via nuclear reactions in the stellar interior the long half-life of the ground state gives good opportunity to be expelled from the star into the interstellar medium before decaying to the excited state of \Mg{26}. Then we would be able to see the decay og \Mg{26} on earth. 

We have observed the $\gamma$-lines from \Mg{26} $\Rightarrow$ nucleosynthesis is currently active (since the timescale ogf \Al{26} half-life is shorter than galactic chemical evolution $\approx 10^10$ y.
